As my career has progressed I've moved more and more away from day-to-day engineering, yet I often still find myself asking, "is such-and-such possible?"
</p>
<p>Good developers are expensive and busy.  And no matter how good they are, how many will you have to hire before you're willing to take their word that something is impossible? It's the things that were thought impossible that are often the most enjoyable to achieve.  This is where being your own developer comes in.

  This year I'm getting a tune-up on my old CS degree.  I never learned full stack or data base.  I've enrolled in Dev BootCamp -- one of the growing number of insanely intensive programmer schools that teach Web or Mobile technologies in 9 or 18 weeks.  I older than most and wonder:
</p>
<ul>
  <li> How have the tools and languages changed? </li>
  <li> How are they the same?</li>
  <li> How does this generation view the startup culture?</li>
  <li> Can I offer them a different perspective?</li>
</ul>
