<p>It turns out that it's a pretty good time in Science, Technology, Engineering and Math to be a woman.  This is even more surprising because it goes against a stereotype that "we all know"...
<div class="rounded_div">

</p><p>
  An  <a href="https://www.umassmed.edu/Global/Diversity%20and%20Equality%20Opportunity%20Office/Documents/WFCBeyondBias%281%29.pdf"> influential report </a> by the National Academy of Sciences in 2006 concluded that "on the average, people are less likely to hire a woman than a man with identical qualifications."
</p><p>
    The under representation of women in academic science is typically attributed, both in scientific literature and in the media, to sexist hiring.

There's a problem with this stereotype.
</p><p>
<p>As reported in the <a href="http://www.pnas.org/content/early/2015/04/08/1418878112.abstract">Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences:</a>
</p> "When we searched the literature, we could not find one empirical study of sexism in faculty hiring using actual faculty members as evaluators and focusing on fields in which women are most underrepresented. So we did the study ourselves."
</p>  <p>
From the study abstract:

<div class="rounded_div">
Here we report five hiring experiments in which faculty evaluated hypothetical female and male applicants, using systematically varied profiles disguising identical scholarship, for assistant professorships in biology, engineering, economics, and psychology. Contrary to prevailing assumptions, men and women faculty members from all four fields <strong>preferred female applicants 2:1 over identically qualified males.</strong>
</div>

</p>  <p>
There is a bias in hiring in Academia and it is hugely in favor of women.  So where does the scarcity of women in STEM come from?

    <a href="http://www.mnn.com/money/sustainable-business-practices/stories/women-avoid-math-and-science-careers-because-they-can#ixzz3YU7kkipY"> Mother Nature Network </a> citing a study by researchers at the University of Pittsburgh and the University of Michigan said...
    <h3> Women avoid math and science careers because they can. (Huh?)</h3> What they found was that "women may be less likely to want careers in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) because they have more career choices, not because they have less ability."
    Women who were good at math tended to also be good at verbal skills.  This was not true of men.  It stands to reason that men who had good math skill but lacked in verbal skill would have a stronger tendency to progress to STEM careers.
    </p><p>
    But if that is true, and the pay for technical jobs is higher than for other jobs, then why are women choosing non-STEM career paths?  In some studies girls drop out of STEM classes in progressively higher numbers starting in adolescence.  As for professional careers, I can see that child-bearing and tenure in academia or advancement in the private sector conflict but in both cases I fail to see why they should disproportionately affect STEM careers.
</p><p>
    I was finally able to find a <a href="http://learning.blogs.nytimes.com/2013/11/22/why-arent-more-girls-choosing-to-pursue-careers-in-math-and-science/comment-page-3/?_r=0">New York Times article </a> that invited girls over 13 to answer that question.  I recommend it.  I was surprised at the number of girls who said, "stop telling me what to do."  I found this extremely literate comment (excerpted from a much larger whole) from a young girl especially interesting:
    </p><p>
<div class="rounded_div">
Last summer I attended a two day rocketry camp at a local community college. When I thought about what awaited me at the camp, the main problem I saw was that the majority of students interested in that topic were likely to be a little bit socially awkward...Making a blanket statement about girls’ sociability is an unfair generalization, but the truth is that many girls who have the aptitude for math and science are being steered away from it because their friends don’t want to take that class or go to that camp. They don’t want to be in a class full of all boys- especially nerdy boys- because who are they supposed to talk to?
</div>
    </p><p>
    This post is too long already so I'll end by a personal anecdote.  My niece is a straight A student.  She excels at math.  She is also very pretty.  Several years ago I asked her why she doesn't want to be a scientist or engineer. Her answer went somthing like this: "Why would I want to hang out with a bunch of nerds?  How am I going to meet anyone?"  And by anyone she meant "boys".
