        <p>It turns out that it's a pretty good time in Science, Technology, Engineering and Math to be a woman. This is
            even more surprising because it goes against a stereotype that "we all know"...

        <div class="rounded_div">

    An <a
        href="https://www.umassmed.edu/Global/Diversity%20and%20Equality%20Opportunity%20Office/Documents/WFCBeyondBias%281%29.pdf">
    influential report </a> by the National Academy of Sciences in 2006 concluded that "on the average, people are less
    likely to hire a woman than a man with identical qualifications."
</p><p>
    The under representation of women in academic science is typically attributed, both in scientific literature and in
    the media, to sexist hiring.

</p><p>
    There's a problem with this stereotype.
</p><p>
<p>As reported in the <a href="http://www.pnas.org/content/early/2015/04/08/1418878112.abstract">Proceedings of the
    National Academy of Sciences:</a>
</p> "When we searched the literature, we could not find one empirical study of sexism in faculty hiring using actual faculty members as evaluators and focusing on fields in which women are most underrepresented. So we did the study ourselves."
</p>  <p>
    From the study abstract:

<div class="rounded_div">
    Here we report five hiring experiments in which faculty evaluated hypothetical female and male applicants, using
    systematically varied profiles disguising identical scholarship, for assistant professorships in biology,
    engineering, economics, and psychology. Contrary to prevailing assumptions, men and women faculty members from all
    four fields <strong>preferred female applicants 2:1 over identically qualified males.</strong>
</div>

</p>  <p>
    There is a bias in hiring in Academia --- it is hugely in favor of women. Industry likely parallels academia as
    everyone from industry comes from that culture. Industry may be ahead or behind the cure but by far the most
    important question remains. The scarcity of women in the sciences in the USA is there before your eyes to see. </p>
<p>
    I have been a hiring manager for programmers and this deficit is so extreme that even work colleagues and members of
    my board of directors who are greatly against affirmative action of any kind have said, "you know it's unhealthy to
    have such an unbalanced workforce." I am paraphrasing here to make the language printable. My response has always
    been the same: "We need to hire 10 engineers. We have 100 applications. Of these, fewer than 5 are women. Even if I
    hire all the women applicants regardless of their qualifications we will still be unbalanced. (In 2015 it may not be
    this bad, but look at the enrollments at coding bootcamps and CS programs. It's not much better despite the need for
    jobs by millennials whose careers have been set back by the financial crisis. </p>
<p>Women do not shy away from difficult tasks if they are motivated. They make strong politicians, good soldiers, they
    work in fields, they make splendid entrepreneurs. Even if you accept the arguments of task specialization put forth
    by socio-biologists -- that woman and men specialize in different abilities in response to evolutionary pressure --
    it doesn't explain the extremes we see. The scarcity of women in STEM begins long before any hiring manager get the
    chance to be biased either for or against women candidates. So where does the extreme scarcity of women in STEM come
    from?</p>

<a href="http://www.mnn.com/money/sustainable-business-practices/stories/women-avoid-math-and-science-careers-because-they-can#ixzz3YU7kkipY">
    Mother Nature
    Network </a> citing a study by researchers at the University of Pittsburgh and the University of Michigan said...
<h3> Women avoid math and science careers because they can. (Huh? I
    thought.)</h3> What they found was that "women may be less likely to want careers in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) because they have more career choices, not because they have less ability."
Women who were good at math tended to also be good at verbal skills.  This was not true of men.  It stands to reason that men who had good math skill but lacked in verbal skill would have a stronger tendency to progress to STEM careers.
</p><p>
    But if that is true, then we should see a pickup in women studying science during economic downturns providing the
    the pay and availability for technical jobs remains high while opportunities for non-STEM jobs contracts. It will be
    interesting to watch for such studies over the next years to see if the financial crisis had this impact. </p>
<p> From a review of the literature, some studies show that girls begin dropping out of STEM classes in progressively
    higher numbers starting in adolescence. This trend may be augmented by issues surrounding child-bearing and the
    granting of tenure in academia while it no doubt affects advancement in the private sector but the trend is already
    strongly in place.
</p><p>
    I was finally able to find a <a
        href="http://learning.blogs.nytimes.com/2013/11/22/why-arent-more-girls-choosing-to-pursue-careers-in-math-and-science/comment-page-3/?_r=0">New
    York Times article </a> that invited girls over 13 to answer that question. I recommend it. I was surprised at the
    number of girls who said, "stop telling me what to do." I found this extremely literate comment (excerpted from a
    much larger whole) from a young girl especially interesting:
</p><p>
<div class="rounded_div">
    Last summer I attended a two day rocketry camp at a local community college. When I thought about what awaited me at
    the camp, the main problem I saw was that the majority of students interested in that topic were likely to be a
    little bit socially awkward. Making a blanket statement about girls’ sociability is an unfair generalization, but
    the truth is that many girls who have the aptitude for math and science are being steered away from it because their
    friends don’t want to take that class or go to that camp. They don’t want to be in a class full of all boys-
    especially nerdy boys- because who are they supposed to talk to?
</div>
<p>
    According to this well spoken youngster there is a real problem was an expectation of social mal-adjustment or at least a perception of social stigma.  I wanted to see for myself so interviewed my niece about this subject. She is a straight A student. She excels at math. She is also very pretty
    and popular. I asked her if she would consider being a scientist or engineer. She said no.  Why? I asked.  Her answer was revealing and paralleled
    the comments of other girls in the NYTimes article. "Why would I want to hang out with them. How am I going to meet
    anyone?" By anyone she meant "boys". When I challenged her, mentioning that the science guys were mostly boys her
    response was immediate and strong. "You know what I mean, I mean real boys." The nerds were, from personal evaluation
    or by acceptance of a socially damning stereotype, so low on the social status totem pole as to be <strong>non-human and
    genderless</strong>. They weren't "boys". What a sad parallel to the most extreme examples of racial stereotypes.
    For her, being associated with "them" was a fate worse than death. Her refusal to let anyone tell her differently seemed to parallel many of
    the "don't tell me what to do" comments from girls in the NYTimes article.
</p>
<p> If we are to accept the conclusions from the studies cited in Mother
    Nature Network, and the endless examples provided me by my niece (which I spare you in this post), the stereotype of the socially backward nerd or geek is not without basis. Why would this be gender specific?   One explanation is that women have more brain
    matter and complexity, in general, devoted to social communication than men. See <a href="http://blog.ted.com/sir_ken_robinso/">here</a> and <a href="http://otherlobe.com/papers/freeing-the-mind-eradicating-gender-inequity-in-higher-education-with-experiential-learning-and-insights-from-neuroscience/">here</a>.  </p>

<p> I was astounded.  Was this "nerd" stereotype justified?  I wanted to see if I could find an independent corroboration of the potential existence of at least a partial basis
    for the stereotype in real life.  I didn't have to look far. The coding "bootcamp" AppAcademy has an introductory lesson
    devoted to proper hygiene, including the need to shower every day. They apologize for having to include such a
    retrograde discussion but state that they do so because a lack of basic grooming and social presentation skills has
    been a problem. I was dumbfounded. I needed another opinion.  I interviewed a friend in grad-school who is a
    bio-chemist, programmer and happens to be an attractive woman. She and I often disagree on social matters and almost always disagree on politics and social policy.  What was her experience? </p>

<div class="rounded_div">
    Yeah, CS related stuff is definitely still male dominated, but not as bad. (And I thrive in that nerdy, wonderful
    world.) Honestly, I think my chemistry degree gets me more grief. If I tell someone that I do computer programming
    stuff, they think "Facebook" or "those dudes from The Social Network", or "someone who works at Google". If I tell them I have a chem degree they usually say/think, "ugh, that class I hated in high school," or "that sounds really
    hard (and not in a good way)". <br>
    One problem that remains is the "geek poser" idea. If I dress well and/or generally
    look good at a geeky conference, there is a class of haters who thinks I can't possibly be a "real" geek/nerd...I do
    have a STEM degree, and am working on another. So, it's annoying to be seen as a poser because I know how to match
    my clothes and am very fond of showers :).
</div>
<p> I found myself astounded at her final remark because the reference to showers and grooming was entirely unprompted. My question had simply been "what has your experience been as a woman in a STEM career." The stereotype that geeks are all socially awkward and unattractive is so strong that she has experienced a countervailing stereotype: if you are not socially/sexually undesirable you must not be technical.</p>
<p> If being socially ostracized is the greatest pain a human can experience, then encouraging girls in STEM subjects is never going to
    get anywhere until this stereotype is abolished. Further, if there is a basis for this stereotype whether it is based in biology as the Mother Nater Network articles suggests, or is simply a self fulfilling stereotype, i.e. those who already don't fit in socially are less affected by threats of being socially ostracized as a result of choosing a STEM path, then changing it will be even harder.  We need to eliminate this stereotype if we are going to allow girls in our society to choose STEM careers without the fear of social rejection and stigma. To do this we will have to educate and train-away any real causes of the stereotype as well.  If this exists and we fail to admit it to ourselves, then are efforts will fail.  What we tell girls will be rejected by their own experience and the pressures of adolescence. As my niece put it, "nobody wants to be associated with "those people."
