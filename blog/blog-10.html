        <p>It turns out that it's a pretty good time in Science, Technology, Engineering and Math to be a woman. This is
            even more surprising because it goes against a stereotype that "we all know:"

        <div class="rounded_div">

</p><p>
    An <a
        href="https://www.umassmed.edu/Global/Diversity%20and%20Equality%20Opportunity%20Office/Documents/WFCBeyondBias%281%29.pdf">
    influential report </a> by the National Academy of Sciences in 2006 concluded that "on the average, people are less
    likely to hire a woman than a man with identical qualifications."
</p><p>
    The under representation of women in academic science is typically attributed, both in scientific literature and in
    the media, to sexist hiring.

</p><p>
    There's a problem with this stereotype.
</p><p>
<p>As reported in the <a href="http://www.pnas.org/content/early/2015/04/08/1418878112.abstract">Proceedings of the
    National Academy of Sciences:</a>
</p> "When we searched the literature, we could not find one empirical study of sexism in faculty hiring using actual faculty members as evaluators and focusing on fields in which women are most underrepresented. So we did the study ourselves."
</p>  <p>
    From the study abstract:

<div class="rounded_div">
    Here we report five hiring experiments in which faculty evaluated hypothetical female and male applicants, using
    systematically varied profiles disguising identical scholarship, for assistant professorships in biology,
    engineering, economics, and psychology. Contrary to prevailing assumptions, men and women faculty members from all
    four fields <strong>preferred female applicants 2:1 over identically qualified males.</strong>
</div>

</p>  <p>
    There is a bias in hiring in academia -- and it is hugely in favor of women. Still, the scarcity of women in the sciences in the USA is there before your eyes to see. It passes what I call "the front door test:" go out your front door into the world and what do you see?</p>
<p>
    I have been a hiring manager for programmers and in my career this deficit has been so extreme that even work colleagues and members of
    my board of directors who are greatly against affirmative action of any kind have said, "you know it's unhealthy to
    have such an unbalanced workforce." My response has been along these lines:
     "We need to hire 10 engineers. We have 100 applications. Of these, fewer than 5 are women. Even if I
    hire all the women applicants regardless of their qualifications we will still be unbalanced." </p>
    <p>
    In 2015 it may not be
    this bad, but if you look at the enrollments at coding boot camps things would seem to have improved little.  If you look at university CS programs over the last two decades, it's gotten worse. </p>
<p>So where does the extreme scarcity of women in STEM come
    from?</p>

<a href="http://www.mnn.com/money/sustainable-business-practices/stories/women-avoid-math-and-science-careers-because-they-can#ixzz3YU7kkipY">
    Mother Nature
    Network </a> citing a study by researchers at the University of Pittsburgh and the University of Michigan said, <strong>   "Women avoid math and science careers because they can.</strong>
    <p>
<div class="rounded_div">
 Women may be less likely to want careers in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) because they have more career choices, not because they have less ability.
Women who were good at math tended to also be good at verbal skills.  This was not true of men.
</div>
<p>
It stands to reason that men who had good math skill but lacked in verbal skill would have a stronger tendency to progress to STEM careers.
    If this is true, then we should see a pickup in women studying science during economic downturns, providing the
    the pay and availability for such technical jobs remains high while opportunities for non-STEM jobs is diminished. It will be
    interesting to watch for such studies over the next years to see if the financial crisis has had this impact. </p>
<p> If women are choosing against careers in STEM, they are also doing so against some pretty strong contrary reasons. Careers in tech are relatively higher paid and the jobs  more plentiful. What conscious or sub-conscious reasons are there against a STEM path?  When does the trend against choosing STEM begin?  A review of the literature shows that girls begin dropping out of STEM classes in progressively
    higher numbers starting early in adolescence. The obvious question is to ask what so unappealing about a STEM path that its effects could be seen that early?
</p><p>
    It took me a while but I finally discovered a <a
        href="http://learning.blogs.nytimes.com/2013/11/22/why-arent-more-girls-choosing-to-pursue-careers-in-math-and-science/comment-page-3/?_r=0">New
    York Times article </a> that invited girls over 13 to answer that very question.   I found this extremely literate comment (excerpted from a
    much larger response) from a 12 year old girl especially interesting:
</p><p>
<div class="rounded_div">
    Last summer I attended a two day rocketry camp at a local community college. When I thought about what awaited me at
    the camp, the main problem I saw was that the majority of students interested in that topic were likely to be a
    little bit socially awkward. Making a blanket statement about girls’ sociability is an unfair generalization, but
    the truth is that many girls who have the aptitude for math and science are being steered away from it because their
    friends don’t want to take that class or go to that camp. They don’t want to be in a class full of all boys-
    especially nerdy boys- because who are they supposed to talk to?
</div>
<p>
    According to this well spoken youngster there is a real expectation that science and math oriented students will be socially mal-adjusted.  There was a strong perception of social stigma attached to them.  I turned to my own sources to support or deny this assertion: I talked to my niece.
    </p>
    <p>
    She is a straight A student. She excels at math. She is also very pretty
    and popular. I asked her if she would consider being a scientist or engineer. She said no.  Why? I asked.  Her answer was revealing and paralleled
    the comments of  girls in the NYTimes article.</p>
<div class="rounded_div">
    "Why would I want to hang out with them. How am I going to meet
    anyone?"
<br><br>
    <em> By anyone she meant "boys". When I challenged her, mentioning that the science types were mostly boys her
    response was immediate and strong.</em>
    <br><br> "You know what I mean, real boys."
    </div><p>
    From talking to her and one of her friends, the nerds were, by either their personal evaluation or by their acceptance of an especially damning social stereotype, so low on the social status totem pole as to be non-human, even genderless.
    Just being associated with "them" came with real social cost.
</p>


<p> I was astounded by all this, so much that I went in search of another real world example. I wanted to see if I could find an independent corroboration, even if it was only anecdotal.  I didn't have to look far. The coding "bootcamp" AppAcademy, a hard core, accelerated full stack web programming program has an extraordinary lesson
    devoted to proper hygiene, including the explicit requirement to shower every day. They apologize for having to include such a
    retrograde discussion but state that they do so because a lack of basic grooming and social presentation skills has
    been a problem. I was dumbfounded. </p>
    <p>
    I then interviewed a friend in grad-school who is a
    bio-chemist, programmer and happens to be an attractive woman. My question was simple, "what has your experience been as a woman in a STEM career." She and I often disagree on social policy matters and almost always disagree on politics, and because of that I find her to be a good reality check. </p>

<div class="rounded_div">
    Yeah, CS related stuff is definitely still male dominated, but not as bad. (And I thrive in that nerdy, wonderful
    world.) Honestly, I think my chemistry degree gets me more grief. If I tell someone that I do computer programming
    stuff, they think "Facebook" or "those dudes from The Social Network", or "someone who works at Google". If I tell them I have a chem degree they usually say/think, "ugh, that class I hated in high school," or "that sounds really
    hard (and not in a good way)". <br><br>
    One problem that remains is the "geek poser" idea. If I dress well and/or generally
    look good at a geeky conference, there is a class of haters who think I can't possibly be a "real" geek/nerd...I do
    have a STEM degree, and am working on another. So, it's annoying to be seen as a poser because I know how to match
    my clothes and am very fond of showers :).
</div>
<p> I found myself astounded at her final remark because the reference to showers and grooming was entirely unprompted. The stereotype that geeks are all socially awkward and unattractive is so strong that she has experienced a countervailing stereotype: if you are not socially/sexually undesirable you must not be technical.</p>
<p>If we are to accept the conclusions of the studies cited in Mother
    Nature Network, and the endless examples provided me by my niece (which I'll spare you in this post), the stereotype of the socially backward nerd or geek is at least partially well-founded. Why would this be
    and why would it be so extremely gender specific?  This post is already too long to look into this more that to pass on a couple of links but one explanation put forth holds that women have more brain
    matter by weight and complexity in areas known to contribute to communication abilities than men.  See <a href="http://blog.ted.com/sir_ken_robinso/">here</a> and <a href="http://otherlobe.com/papers/freeing-the-mind-eradicating-gender-inequity-in-higher-education-with-experiential-learning-and-insights-from-neuroscience/">here</a>. Evolutionary biologists hold that there are good reasons for gender based ability differences. </p>

<p> If being socially ostracized is the greatest pain a human can experience, then encouraging girls in STEM subjects is never going to
    get anywhere until the stereotype and stigma attached is abolished. Further, if there is a basis for this stereotype, whether it is based in biology or is simply a self fulfilling stereotype, i.e. those who already don't fit in socially are less affected by threats of being socially ostracized as a result of choosing a STEM path, then changing it will be even harder. Skills, both social and technical can successfully be taught.
    </p>
    <p>
        We need to eliminate this stereotype if we are going to allow girls in our society to choose STEM careers without the fear of social rejection and stigma. To do this we will have to educate and train-away any real causes of the stereotype as well.  If we fail even to admit the problem to ourselves, then our efforts will fail.  Anything we tell girls will be rejected by something far more powerful: their own life experiences and the pressures of adolescence.
