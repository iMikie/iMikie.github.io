<h3 id="toc_0">This is me...</h3>

<p>At the end of week 3 DBC has asked us to reflect on our thinking styles. This post is on my Gregoric style. You can
    click on the image to learn more. Basically, you answer a bunch of questions and the system develops a profile. </p>

<p>I&#39;m so Concrete Random that it&#39;s a bit erie. I&#39;m experimenting all over the place, this site is going well, but at the same time I'm finishing up my reflections late at night.
     I&#39;m not so good on routine. </p>

<p>My biggest struggle at this point is that my eyes are bigger than my mouth. But you know what, I&#39;m succeeding
    because it&#39;s so much easier to be a developer now. I would be dead so many times over if this were 15 years ago.
    Now I run into problems and they just fall. I look on Stackoverflow, or think up a good google string, and someone&#39;s
    posted a solution. </p>

<p>Want to reload the parent of the parent of your embedded iframe and you don&#39;t want it to scroll? There&#39;s a
    post for that. I couldn&#39;t understand why Chrome wasn&#39;t displaying my site properly and Safari was. </p>

<p><img src="imgs/web_security.png" alt="fixing Chrome" width="723" height="34"/></p>

<p>Turns out it was a security problem that only happens when you run off a local machine on Chrome. No book or lecture
    mentioned that. But it took all of 15-20 minutes to find a post. You can fix it but it takes a command line argument
    when starting up Chrome. How long would that have taken in the past?</p>

<p>I think these modern times have swung to my way of thinking. Because I&#39;m able to find the answers, it&#39;s
    easier to set a time limit and with DBC, I can always bring the problem to my class and instructors. There&#39;s no
    reason to get stuck in the rabbit hole. This is my worst achilles' heal to watch and plan for.  Still I relish the fact that the world has made life easier for me. Nice to think that at least in this way something has gone very right in the last 20 years. </p>

<p>I&#39;m actually starting to give myself 20 minutes timeboxes. I think if I can balance just a few routines, I can
    improve my learning speed.</p>

<p>I went into product marketing and ultimately executive management because 20 years ago programming just wasn&#39;t
    fun. Now it is. </p>
