Dev BootCamp is an intense 9 week remote + 9 week on-site full stack course, Ruby/Rails/Javascript/SQL/HTML/CSS.  It promises to be intense.
</p><p>
Who comes?  The majority appear to be millennials as you might expect, making a change in their careers.  I wonder how many are reacting from the bad blows struck them by the Final Crisis.  I've read studies that show those who graduated into the job market over the last 7 years will never fully recover.  At the same time, full stack developers in San Francisco start at $100,000, a bit less elsewhere. This makes for some very motivated people.
</p><p>

It's a pretty varied group. We have some very bright math, mechanical engineering, biology, law, and other folks switching from their chosen field.  Then there are a few of us that don't really fit any mold.
</p><p>

Boot Camp.   I'm in the part-time "phase 0".  It must be tough for people with real jobs and who haven't programmed much before to keep up.  I watched a "fireside chat" video blog by one of the founders who, when talking about the full time phase, made a semi serious comment about writing a letter to your loved ones letting them know you are going to be checking out for a while.

Time Management: unless you adopt some pretty good strategies you will fail.  The first day is all about time management.  Timeboxing is straight from agile: you can't afford to get bogged down.  Move on and come back to it.  Pomodoro is timbering in windows of 25 minute tasks. I go down rabbit holes, like deciding to make this blog pretty by experimenting with wire framing tools.  I will have to really watch that and likely start timbering.
</p><p>

Dev BootCamp is also big on yoga, meditation.  They have us study emotional intelligence and learn how to give feedback (kind, actionable and specific.)  At first it was a bit unicorns and rainbows for me but the assertion is that most people and teams fail not for technical reasons and so the course has been adjusted.  The founders are also really big into studying learning itself and rather than proselytizing appear to be simply making up for a lack of what really should be taught in school.  The theories they present are pretty dense and based on a lot of research.

Having a Growth Mindset is about those who look at challenges as a proof of their merit don't do nearly as well as those who look at challenges as an opportunity to grow.  This leads into...
</p><p>
Kitchen Culture: the notion that rather than purchasing a set of classes and exams think of this as friends getting together to cook dinner.  Students are required to pair program, to reach out to each other, to post their questions to the group (even though instructors may answer). This is going to be socially intense as well.

It’s said that there is a special bond between those who have gone to combat together.  Maybe that’s what we are entering.  This feels like when you join a higher league in a sport.
