    Comparing Arrays and Hashes
</header>
<main>

    <p>
        I went a little crazy with this assignment. I'm summarizing the Ruby language. It's a quick reference. This is
        what I think we have to memorize to be proficient. It's the Minimum Viable amount to really master. It's not
        small but it's a lot smaller than the entire thing. Of course this will grow as we learn more but my hope is to
        have a concise, here's-what-you-have-to-know for everything.
    </p>

    <p>
        This is forcing me to write code with every one of the methods, iterator block formats and try to explain them each in one sentence.
    </p>
    <p>
    Did you know that arrays and strings share many of the Enumeration methods? You can index a string as well as an
    array. You can use many of the same iterators.

        I invite you to check it out. Click on the <a href="http://iMikie.github.io/site-master.html"/>Blog Home</a> and
        then click "Ruby Cheat Sheet" under Posts. Arrays, Strings, Integers are done, and Hashes will be soon.
