    No SQL?
</header>
<figure class="definition">
    <span class="large_definition">no·SQL</span>
    <br>
    <span class="pronunciation"> ˈnō-ess-qu-'el</span>
<br>    <em>noun</em>
        <p>Provides a mechanism for the storage and retrieval of data that is modeled in means other than the
            tabular relations used in relational databases. Translation: NoSQL is different from SQL. No kidding.</p>

    <p> Even a new student of WebTech can't help but notice
        the
        rise of "noSQL" databases. What are they and do I need to learn them? A quick glance over to Wikipedia reveals an abysmal article full of jargon and little
        explanation. I imagine some gnome whose only purpose was to demostrate that
        he knows something I don't. Even over at Mongo you get painfully awkward sentences like
        "Some
        key-value stores, such as Redis, allow each value to have a type, such as "integer", which adds functionality".
        Take away: integers add functionality to some things.  Seriously, maybe I should get a job as a writer instead.
    </p>

    <p>
        OK, so what can we say? It appears that noSQL has become popular with the rise of social media and the massive
        data generated from
        spying on
        every aspect of users online lives: what they purchase, the web-pages they visit, how long they stay there, who
        they are
        connected to, etc. If SQL was designed to connect customers with products and record their orders, this new type
        of data needs something different.  OK, so what choices do we have?
    </p>

    <p>

    <h3>NoSQL Database Types</h3>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Document databases</strong> pair a search key with data structured into a "document". Documents can
            contain
            many different key-value pairs, or key-array pairs, or even nested documents.
        </li>
        <li><strong>Graph stores</strong>   are used to store information about networks, such as social connections.  It looks
            like these are nodes containing data with links between nodes.
        </li>
        <li><strong>Wide-column</strong> stores such as Cassandra and HBase are optimized for queries over large
            datasets, and store columns of data together, instead of rows.
        </li>
        <li><strong>Graph</strong> appear to be implemented as serialized objects that have pointers to other
            objects.  The graph database manager can follow these networks of objects.
        </li>

    </ul>
    <p>
        So why use a no-SQL database? Oh, 'cause they are more scalable and offer superior performance. Note to reader: if you
        are
        ever asked to be a marketing person, just write "more scalable and better performance".  It doesn't really matter
        what you are selling.  I ran into that phrase a lot.  OK, here's what we can say...maybe.
    </p>

    <h3>Storing Data when you don't know it will be</h3>

    <p>
        Relational databases require that schemas be defined before you can add data. For example, you might want to
        store
        data about your customers such as phone numbers, first and last name, address, city and state. So if you decide,
        a
        few iterations into development, that you'd like to store customers' favorite items in addition to their
        addresses
        and phone numbers, you'll need to add that column to the database, and then migrate the entire database to the
        new
        schema.
    </p>

    <h3>Distributing the database</h3>
    Here is another "gotta have" feature which is never explained well. If your data grows without bounds, then
    eventually it might be nice to divide it over several servers. It's easy to see that if you want to search
    for customers with in some location then if that data is on several servers, you gotta talk to all the servers.
    Evidentially there is no easy way to split up Relational tables and still query against the entire dataset.  Evidentially as well
    there are ways to provide this with noSQL databases automatically.  Alas, I was not able to find a competent
    explanation as to how this is done.  Just accept that it is.
    <h3>Replication and Redundancy</h3>
    Backing up an SQL database and keeping both copies up-to-date is evidentially difficult but easy to do with
    a non SQL database.  Once again, this claim was repeated over and over, while I could not find a simple explanation.
    Unfortunately I can't tell you why and how this works.
    <p>
        It's pretty clear that the particular suitability of a given NoSQL database depends on the problem it must solve but
        unfortunately the tech writers these companies hire don't seem to be able to give any concrete examples.  In the meantime
        I'm sure it's "more better", less downtime, more agile, non-proprietary...
