    No SQL?
</header>
<figure class="definition">
    <span class="large_definition">no·SQL</span>
    <br>
    <span class="pronunciation"> ˈnō-ess-qu-'el</span>
<br>    <em>noun</em>
        <p>Provides a mechanism for the storage and retrieval of data that is modeled in means other than the
            tabular relations used in relational databases. Translation: NoSQL is different from SQL. No kidding.</p>

    <p> Even a new student of WebTech can't help but notice
        the
        rise of "noSQL" databases. What are they and do I need to learn them? A quick glance over to Wikipedia reveals an abysmal article full of jargon and little
        explanation. I imagine some gnome whose only purpose was to demostrate that
        he knows something I don't. (He succeeded.)
        </p><p>
    Over at Mongo you get some good explanation along with painfully awkward dropouts like
        "Some
        key-value stores allow each value to have a type, such as "integer", which adds functionality."
      Integers add functionality.  Got it.
    </p>

    <p>
        OK, so what can we say? It appears that noSQL has become popular with the rise of social media and the generation of massive
        data from
        <strike>spying on</strike> recording
        every aspect of our online lives: what we purchase, the web-pages we visit, how long we stay there, who
        we are
        connected to, etc. A first hesitant conclusion: SQL was designed to connect customers with products and record their orders.  This new type
        of data needs something different.  OK, so what choices do we have?
    </p>

    <p>

    <h3>NoSQL Database Types</h3>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Document databases</strong> pair a search key with data structured into a "document". Documents can
            contain
            many different key-value pairs, or key-array pairs, or even nested documents.
        </li>
        <li><strong>Graph stores</strong>   are used to store information about networks, such as social connections.  It looks
            like these are nodes containing data with links between nodes.
        </li>
        <li><strong>Wide-column</strong> stores such as Cassandra and HBase are optimized for queries over large
            datasets, and store columns of data together, instead of rows.
        </li>
        <li><strong>Graphs</strong> appear to be implemented as serialized objects that have pointers to other
            objects.  The graph database manager can follow these networks of objects.
        </li>

    </ul>
    <p>
        So why use a no-SQL database? Because they are "more scalable and offer superior performance." Note to reader: if you
        are
        ever asked to be a marketing person, just write "more scalable and better performance".  It doesn't really matter
        what you are selling. OK, here's what we can say...maybe.
    </p>

    <h3>Storing Data when you don't know it will be</h3>

    <p>
        Relational databases require that schemas be defined before you can add data. For example, you might want to
        store
        data about your customers such as phone numbers, first and last name, address, city and state. So if you decide,
        a
        few iterations into development, that you'd like to store customers' favorite items in addition to their
        addresses
        and phone numbers, you'll need to add that column to the database, and then migrate the entire database to the
        new
        schema.
    </p>

    <h3>Distributing the database</h3>
    This is another "gotta have" feature which I never found explained terribly well, but here goes. If your data grows without bounds, then
    eventually it might be nice to divide it over several servers. It's easy to see that if you want to search
    for customers with in some in some category then if that data is on several servers, you gotta talk to all the servers.
    Evidently there is no easy way to split up Relational tables and still query against the entire dataset.  It appears
    there are ways to provide this with noSQL databases automatically.  Alas, I was not able to find a good
    explanation as to how exactly and under what parameters this is actually done.  Just accept that it is.
    <h3>Replication and Redundancy</h3>
    Backing up a database and keeping both copies up-to-date appears to also be a classically difficult Relational problem but easy and automatic
    to do with
    a non SQL database.  Once again, although this claim was repeated over and over,  I could not find a simple explanation of how it's done.
    <p>
        It's pretty clear that the particular suitability of a given NoSQL database depends on the problem it must solve but
        unfortunately the tech writers these companies hire don't seem to be able to give any concrete examples.  In the meantime
        I'm sure it's "more better", more scalable, superior performance, less downtime, more agile, non-proprietary...
