        You know what an instance variable is. You are probably familiar with class variables as well and how you might
        use them: like having a Player class keep track of how many players are in a game. Player's initialize method
        could increment a class variable to keep track of how many players are in the game.
    </p>
    <p>
        So what are Class-Instance variables, how are they created and why might you use one? Class-instance variables
        are a good test of how well you understand scoping
        in Ruby.
    </p>

    <p>
        Let's say we manage a marina, and it's our job to rent out the boats. We've got a Ruby program to keep track of
        them: how many are out on the water, and how many are in storage and available to rent etc. Let's say we have
        two types of boats, motor boats and real boats, you know, the kind with sails. So in addition to class Boat we
        have two sub-classes: Sailboat and Motorboat. </p>
    <pre class="green_code">
        class Boat
        ...
        end

        class Sailboat < Boat
        end

        class Motorboat < Boat
        end

</pre>


    <p>We want to keep track of how many boats are in or out at any moment. </p>

    <p>
        Our workflow is like this:
    <ol>
        <li> Check boats out when someone rents them</li>
        <li> Check boats back in when they are brought back</li>
    </ol>
    <p>
        The first thing we might do is to create a couple of class variables like this:</p>
     <pre class="green_code">
   class Boat
     @@in = 0
     @@out = 0
   end
    </pre>

    <p> Then every time we check out a sailboat or motorboat we could increment the class variable:</p>

    <pre class="green_code">

  def self.Checkin()
    @@in += 1
    @@out += 1
  end

  def self.Checkout()
    if @@in > 0
      @@in -= 1
      @@out += 1
      return true
    end
    false
  end
    </pre>

    We can use class methods Checkin and Checkout to keep track for us. This works fine to keep track of boats in
    general but there is a problem with this. If we want to track sailboats separately from motorboats it won't work. The
    class variables @@in and @@out are owned by the base class Boat so that even if we call:

     <pre class="green_code">
  Sailboat.Checkout
  Motorboat.Checkout
         </pre>
    <p>
        It's the class variables in Boat that will be modified.  Even if we declare these @@variables in the class
        Sailboat and class Motorboat, they will still be owned by the class Boat. OK, we say to ourselves, we'll just
        use instance variables in the Sailboat and Motorboat classes. The problem there is that instance variables live
        inside the individual Sailboat or Motorboat objects and each instance has it's own scope, naturally it's a
        different object. So now need something else to keep track of the Sailboats out versus the Motorboats out.</p>

    <p>
        What we need is a "sub-class" class variable, but how do we do that?
    </p>

    <p>
        Well, in Ruby, everything is an object, even a class is an object, maybe we can give the class object
        an instance variable. Now remember that the initialize method is a class method that gets called by the
        <strong> .new </strong> method as in <strong>my_boat = Sailboat.new</strong>. Remember also that from initialize we can call
        the method <strong> super</strong> to switch to the super class's method of the same name if we need to. This
        implies that when we call a class method of Sailboat, such as <strong>Sailboat.Checkin</strong>, then within that method, <strong>self = Sailboat</strong>.
        class. Like this:
    </p>
     <pre class="green_code">
  class Boat
    def self.Hello
        puts "Here I am!"
        puts "I'm in class: #{self}"
    end
  end
    class Sailboat < Boat
  end

  Sailboat.Hello
</pre>

    <p> What do you think it will return? You may be surprised.</p>
<pre class="green_code">
  Here I am!
  I'm in class: Context::Sailboat
  => nil
   </pre>

    <p> We'll use this for our final solution below. We'll manually define setters and getters for self.in and self.out
        methods. When these get executed <strong> self</strong>will be our immediate class, not the base class. Putting
        it all together, it looks like this.
    <pre class="green_code">
class Boat

  def self.Checkin()
    self.in += 1
    self.out -= 1
    Boat.in += 1
    Boat.out -= 1

  end

  def self.Checkout()
    if self.in > 0
      self.in -= 1
      self.out += 1
      Boat.in -= 1
      Boat.out += 1
      return true
    end
    false
  end

  def self.StartMorning
    self.in = 10
    Boat.in += 10
  end

  def self.EndEvening
    self.in -= 10
    Boat.in -= 10
  end

  def self.in
    @in ||= 0
  end

  def self.in=(num)
    @in = num
  end

  def self.out
    @out ||= 0
  end

  def self.out=(num)
    @out=num
  end

end

class Sailboat < Boat
end

class Motorboat < Boat
end
</pre>

    <p>Note that everything is done is class Boat. Class Sailboat and Motorboat don't actually do anything. Everything
        depends on the value of <strong>self</strong> when our class methods are called. </p>

    <p>
        We start each morning by Checking in our 10 sailboats and 10 motorboats. Then we have routines for checking
        boats in
        and checking them out during the day. We've defined the getter and setter for our <strong>in</strong> and
        <strong>out</strong> variables. These are out class-instance variables. Whether a Sailboat or Motorboat
        class-instance variable is set or get depends on the value of <strong>self</strong> when <strong>in</strong> or
        <strong>out</strong>. </p>

    <p>
        Looking at the code of the setters it looks like just an instance variable is getting set, e.g. @in or @out. But
        ask yourself, what is the value of self when they are called? I constructed this
        example specifically so that no Boat, Motorboat, or Sailboat instance objects are ever created so they can't be
        instance variables! We are really setting class-instance variables here. Which
        ones, Sailboat or Motorboat, (or Boat) get set depends on the value of self when Checkin or
        Checkout are called. Sailboat.Checkin will do what it's name implies, it will checkin a sailboat!</p>

    <p>
        Modifying the class-instance variables of Boat in Checkin and Checkout are easy, we can specifically prefix them
        with Boat as in
        <strong>Boat.in</strong> and <strong>Boat.out</strong>. </p>

    <p>
        OK, let's test this. We'll write a little print status
        stand-alone method so that we can easily see what our test code has done. We'll call StartMorning for Sailboats
        and Motorboats, then we'll check some boats out and see that we are indeed accessing class variables and
        class-instance variables. </p>

<pre class="green_code">
    def print_boats_status
      puts "Sailboats in: #{Sailboat.in}"
      puts "Motorboats in: #{Motorboat.in}"
      puts
      puts "Sailboats out: #{Sailboat.out}"
      puts "Motorboat out: #{Motorboat.out}"
      puts
      puts "Boats in: #{Boat.in}"
      puts "Boats out: #{Boat.out}"
      puts "----------------------------------"
    end

    Sailboat.StartMorning
    Motorboat.StartMorning
    print_boats_status

    2.times { Sailboat.Checkout }
    6.times { Motorboat.Checkout }

    print_boats_status
        </pre>

    <p> When we run the test code above, this is what we get: </p>
            <pre class="green_code">
  Sailboats in: 10
  Motorboats in: 10

  Sailboats out: 0
  Motorboat out: 0

  Boats in: 20
  Boats out: 0
  ----------------------------------
  Sailboats in: 8
  Motorboats in: 4

  Sailboats out: 2
  Motorboat out: 6

  Boats in: 12
  Boats out: 8
  ----------------------------------
</pre>
    <p>
        If you've stuck with me this far, then you probably now have a really good idea of scoping in classes in Ruby.
        When I set out to write this blog post I didn't know about class-instance variables and just tried using @@in
        and @@out. Boy was I surprised. I still rather think that @@ should work as I expected it to, that is, not to
        refer all the way back to the base class. Now here's a question for you if you think you've got it down pat: are
        Boat.in and Boat.out class variables or class-instance variables? If they are class-instance variables how would
        you modify the code to use class variables?</p>
