    <p>The command line is all well and good but an IDE can make you so much faster. </p>

    <p>In the 70's the haircuts and the development tools were pretty bad. Well the haricuts have changed; command line
        tools, not so much. As neophytes at DevBootCamp we edit a Debugger statement into the code, save it, go to the terminal, open a REPL, load
        the file, run it, hit the debug statement, type out some variables, etc. You gotta wonder. </p>

    <p>
        That's all of two quick clicks for an IDE.</p>

    <p> If having your hand leave the keyboard for the mouse slows you down, then leaving your entire environment to
        reload and run primitive tools has gotta be orders of magnitude worse.

    <p>You need to know those tools, but I've been checking out RubyMine to see if it will take my Ruby to the next level.  I'm really liking it. Maybe it's right for you, maybe not. I've
        endeavored to show in 5 minutes a few things you can use right away.</p>

    <p> Thanks for watching. </p>
