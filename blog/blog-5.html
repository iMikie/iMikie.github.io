    <p> As neophytes at DevBootCamp we edit a Debugger statement into the code, save it, go to the terminal, open irb or pry, load the file, run it, hit the debug statement, type out some variables, etc.  </p>

    <p> If having your hand leave the keyboard for the mouse slows you down, then leaving your entire environment to
        reload and run your program has gotta be orders of magnitude worse. </p>

    <p>I've been checking out RubyMine to see if it will take my Ruby to the next level.  I'm really liking it. I've endeavored to show in 5 minutes a few things you can use right away.</p>

    <p> Thanks for watching. </p>
