    <p>
        In the early 90's I was working at Apple, "between Jobs" as they say. I started as a young QA
        engineer on a scripting language called HyperTalk which was used for a hypertext environment called HyperCard.
        It was
        created by the inventor of Quicktime and an original Macintosh team member, the brilliant Bill Atkinson. The
        language had not
        been formally defined though Bill had a pretty clear idea of what he wanted. Having a formal grammar gives you
        something to test against so I wrote a grammar for it.
        That grammar became the basis
        of, or at least a resource for several texts on the language as well as some follow on languages, as was evident
        by the naming conventions
        I chose and a few little errors I made that got copied for years.
    </p>

    <p>
        It looked like something like this, with some modifications I added in later languge projects:

    <div class="grey_code">
        info = fields 1 to 4 of form "registration"
        <br>
        my_ref = a reference to all fields named "quotation"
        <br>
        set the style of the text of my_ref to (bold, italic)
        <br>
        set the path of image "sunset" to "../images/sunset.jpg"
    </div>
    </p><p>
    Imagine the code you'd have to write in JavaScript or JQuery for that today and you'll get an idea of its simple
    power.
</p>

    <p>
        After a stint in international marketing I returned to scripting languages workking on
        AppleScript and
        the underlying library that provided the ability for any application to connect the scripting language to it's DOM.
    </p>
    <p>
        Being able to specify elements in a page based on the DOM regardless of the underlying data
        representation was rather novel in 1992.
    </p>

    <p>
        I had a sabbatical coming up, and so on my way out the door I stopped by Tech Support to chat. Like many Silicon
        Valley firms, Apple had a tendency to live it its own bubble. In a way, the Tech Support guys
         were the blue collar mechanics who dealt with reality rather than theory and kept the vehicle going. My people.
        They had a good sense of what was going on outside the bubble.
    </p>

    <p>
        And they drank a lot of Mountain Dew.
    </p>


    <p>
        "What's new and interesting?" I asked.
    </p> <p>
        "Have you seen Mosaic? It's a lot like HyperCard but it runs on TCP/IP.  It was invented by a guy named Tim
        Berners Lee and he cites HyperCard as one of his inspirations. Didn't you work on HyperCard?"
    </p>

    <p>
        I had and if fact had argued strongly that we should enable HyperCard to run over TCP/IP and worked with a
        European
        engineer Richard Moore, to change it's proprietary file format to some version of SGML. Alas, that never got off the
        ground.
    </p>

    <p>
        It was clear to me and many others that the era of proprietary networking would soon be over. Still Novel was
        king with Netware (It's CEO was Eric Schmidt), Microsoft had it's own networking protocol and Apple had
        AppleTalk.
    </p>

    <p>
        "How do I get Mosaic?" I asked.
    </p>

    <p>
        "You can get it via dialup from NCSA. A guy named Mark Andreessen is working on it. You gotta get MacTCP and
        hack your system a little. You also need a dialup connection to the Internet."
    </p>
    <p>I got excited.</p>
    <p>
        On sabbatical I recreated Mosaic inside ClarisWorks, but unlike Mosaic where Mark Andreessen had just
        added GIFs, I added GIFs, JPGs, Quicktime movies, full live embedded spreadsheets (think Google Docs) and
        database connectivity through something called MacWorkstation.
    </p>

    <p>
        ClarisWorks was an integrated app, like Microsoft Works, if you remember that, so a lot of that functionality
        came for free. It had it's own WYSIWIG
        text editor (what became Pages I believe, or at least its notion simplicity), a graphics editor, paint program,
        and spreadsheet and database modules. So my little Browser got a web page editing environment for free.
        ClarisWorks even had a built-in dialer for getting online. We could bundle it with TCP/IP and have a
        complete solution.
    </p>

    <p>
        Then I tried and tried but I couldn't sell the idea internally at Apple. There were conflicting group interests.
        ClarisWorks was part
        of Claris, a company that had been spun out of Apple. NIH at Apple was pretty thick. The networking group
        objected because
        TCP/IP wasn't AppleTalk. The HyperCard group objected because they already had HyperCard but HyperCard didn't
        support HTTP or the PC.  I don't think they really got or
        believed
        in communicating text based pages via a server side application.
    </p>
    <p>
        So I left Apple.
    </p>

    <p>
        One thing clear to me, even if it was not generally clear then, was that like HyperCard, Mosaic needed a scripting language.
        As soon as you had fields, buttons, and text entry forms,
        you needed scripting. In
        HyperCard you could do everything you can do today in the Browser's DOM with
        JavaScript and JQuery. The fact that JQuery had to be invented and is used on nearly 1/4 of the Web these days is a
        testament that something was/is missing in JavaScript.
    </p>

    <p>
        Besides, it made no sense that tiny change meant going back to the server to redraw the entire
        page.
        Remember that in those days, Internet download and upload speeds were reported in kilobytes, not megabytes.
        I contacted NCSA and they told me to contact Sun, the "custodians" of the NCSA code.
    </p>

    <p>
        So I marched over to Sun. Bill Joy had recently taken over the Oak programming language group. The language was
        renamed Java. As one of the founders of Sun, Bill got and kept executive level attention for Java. I
        got to meet the whole team, but was told that Bill was the guy to talk to.
    </p>
    <p>
        I pitched him on the need for a client side scripting language. It
        was a big
        deal for me. Likely just one of a million things he did that week.
    </p>



    I talked about AppleScript and waxed on about how a lightweight scripting language was needed as part of the
    browser, how it could talk to a server (and my being unashamedly obsequious, that server would be written in Java!)
    <p>
        Following the naming of AppleScript and the JapanScript version of it that an Apple engineer named Eric House
        had created at Apple—and in an effort to kiss up to Bill Joy as much as possible, I called my language
        "JavaScript."
    </p>

    <p>
        Bill Joy's response was, "Java doesn't need a scripting language."  You see the browser had the Java plugin.
    </p>
    <p>
        I remember being speechless. Java was never going to succeed client side. It was all wrong
        for that. Plugins would never work.
    </p>

    <p>
        Don't run in a frame in the page. Be the page.
    </p>
    <div class="grey_code">
        orderResult = sendServer("OrderItem", item, price)<br>
        put orderResult after the text of field "order"
        <br>
        set the font of each listitem whose name is "Order" to "Courier"
    </div>
    <p>
        You can see some of the power of this language today over at <a href="www.livecode.com"> LiveCode </a> where you
        can create a single app and save
        it as an iPhone, Macintosh, Android, or Windows app and soon as a WebApp. Usually you can do in 1 or two lines
        of LiveCode script what it takes 20 to 100 lines of Java or JavaScript.
    </p>

    <p>
        Discussions with Sun were going well. At least I thought so. The marketing position for Java was taken over by
        an ex-Apple employee I knew. Then as December 1995 approached, everything went silent. No one answered the
        phone. It turns out that Netscape and Brendan Eich had also seen the need for a Browser scripting language and
        they wanted their language, Mocha, blessed as an official part of Mosaic.
        Sun wanted Netscape, who was winning the browser wars to endorse Java and bundle the Java plugin with the
        Netscape browser.
        I discovered the disappointing news by reading the press release.
    </p>
    <p>
        The only thing they kept from my efforts was the name, "JavaScript".  It was my rather transparent attempt to kiss up to
        Sun and it was a nod to having Java run your server while JavaScript ran the client.
        Still, I never intended that name to actually be used in public.
        It was completely different language from Java by design. It solved a different problem.


    </p><p>
    But someone liked it. Perhaps the Netscape people thought that by associating it with Java, it might be more easily
 accepted.
        Calling it Mocha would have been better, or more descriptively,
        HTMLScript, HyperScript, or even WebScript.  (Anything else except ECMAScript which is no doubt
        why we still call it JavaScript.) As for my little world I had to convince Apple colleagues and programmer friends
        that this JavaScript wasn't my fault.
    </p>
    <p>
        So that's how it happened.
       <p class="embedded_aside">
    An Oracle engineer once said to me, "there is so much wrong with
    JavaScript -- is it really surprising
    that the name was the first thing they got wrong??
</p>

<h3>Epilogue</h3>
    <p>
        As for me this was the biggest conflict and loss I'd ever experienced.  I was half a million in debt. Time
        to scramble. Time for a new business plan.
        At this time ISP's didn't care about Mac. So I started writing software that enabled 500 or so of the first ISPs to
        support Macintosh. Later, it became clear that the cable companies would own broadband Internet.
        Time to pivot again. The Internet was taking off Internationally and from my stint in Apple's International
        product marketing group I had managed localization for HyperCard. I knew how to test
        languages
        and translate into international languages products with scripting languages. I reformed my company to produce
        Internet Starter Kits in 7
        languages. Our biggest customer ended up being Netscape. Netscape which had killed us, then saved us.
    </p>

    <p>
        After a hard year of contract work I'd saved up $750k. I could take the money and run, but my first attempt at
        a startup had cost my investors nearly $500k. Doing contract work doesn't make you rich so I wrote each
        of my original investors a check for the amount they had invested and I paper cliped it to a new business
        plan. The next big thing was going to be small devices I said. It was 1999 and we had been working on a phone
        and tablet prototype. Instead of Windows, it would be Linux based. Where the Palm Pilot was
        1 bit per pixel black and white, we had a color touch interface.
    </p>

    <p>
        The investors were so surprised to see their money again they each tore up their checks and said "go for it."
        Then they helped me find investors for a second angel round and then a small venture round. In 9 months we sold the
        company to Macromedia/Adobe and I retired. What got us bought was our implementation of Mobile Flash.
    </p>

    <p>
        Today I am taking DevBootCamp to finally learn the real JavaScript. I was never able to bring myself to do it
        before. Now there are new libraries like JQuery that make it more tolerable. There are new languages, like Ruby
        that are very clean.

    </p>
    <p>
        If there is a moral to this story it is that you have to roll with the punches in the startup world.
        You have to pivot to survive. You win some, you lose
        more. You can't hold grudges. Still, I wonder what programming the Web might have been like with a better
        scripting
        language.
    </p>

    <p>
        We may get to see what that will look like all these many of years later when LiveCode releases their next major
        version which will include web app development.
